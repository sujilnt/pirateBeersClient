Then finally, an opening. There before them was a lush, fertile valley, brimming with the most beautiful flora and fauna they had ever seen. In the middle of the valley was the most perfect apple tree with an enormous serpent hanging from the highest branch. Could it be true? Had he found the ultimate prize?\n\nWe proudly present the Forbidden Traveler — a crisp fellow with a taboo disposition.\n\n \n\nForbidden Traveler is a crisp, wheat beer made with real apple. Its bright effervescence will catch your eye, while its refreshing aroma will tempt your senses. It’s here for the picking, just take a sip.",

Noble-type hop aroma and flavor are moderate and quite obvious. It is a well-attenuated, medium-light bodied beer, but a malty residual sweetness can be perceived in aroma and flavor. Very low levels of sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) character are below most beer drinkers' taste thresholds and are usually not detectable except to the trained or sensitive palate. Other fermentation or hop related sulfur compounds, when perceived at low levels, may be characteristic of this style. Fruity esters and diacetyl should not be perceived. There should be no chill haze. Its head should be dense and rich.",

    "product_description_2": "Robust porters are black in color and have a roast malt flavor, often reminiscent of cocoa, but no roast barley flavor. These porters have a sharp bitterness of black malt without a highly burnt/charcoal flavor. Caramel and other malt sweetness should be present and in harmony with other distinguishing porter characters. Robust porters range from medium to full in body and have a malty sweetness. Hop bitterness is medium to high, with hop aroma and flavor ranging from negligible to medium. Diacetyl is acceptable at very low levels. Fruity esters should be evident, balanced with roast malt and hop bitterness.",
